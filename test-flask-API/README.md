## Automated API Testing for Retail Order Management System

The test_api.py file automates testing for a Flask API using pytest, requests, and json. It includes a function to reformat API responses
and multiple test cases that validate the APIâ€™s error handling and data processing capabilities. Tests involve sending HTTP requests,
comparing JSON responses against expected results, and verifying correct functionality for fetching and sorting order data based on
customer input, billing, and shipping details. Each test ensures the API's reliability and accuracy, crucial for maintaining consistent 
backend operations within the retail order management system.
